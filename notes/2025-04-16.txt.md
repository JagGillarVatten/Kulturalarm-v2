This web application integrates three core modules to provide a dynamic, interactive schedule management system:

1. Storage Module (Storage.js):
- Manages application configuration and persistent data storage
- Handles localStorage interactions for saving user preferences
- Provides utilities for adding/removing custom schema URLs
- Maintains application state across browser sessions

2. Time Module (Time.js):
- Handles real-time clock and event processing
- Dynamically updates UI with current and upcoming events
- Parses complex event information
- Manages schedule fetching and initialization
- Provides time-related utility functions

3. Logic Module (Logic.js):
- Coordinates overall application interactions
- Manages custom URL configurations
- Handles schema selection and switching
- Sets up event listeners for user interactions
- Defines music-related subject categories

Interconnected Workflow:
- Storage module provides persistent configuration
- Time module processes and displays schedule events
- Logic module manages user interactions and state transitions

The application creates a seamless, user-friendly experience for managing schedules, with robust state management, dynamic UI updates, and persistent configurations.
